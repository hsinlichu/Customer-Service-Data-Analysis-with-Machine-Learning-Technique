    "這個主題是因為想要透過類似主題的方式，讓客人在還沒有將問題提交前就可以得到類似問題的解答，以期可以解決簡單的客人問題，並且減少客訴的量。\n",
    "這邊我使用的方式是使用 Bert 來做骨幹架構，來表示出 sentence。\n",
    "其中 Bert 我是使用 [bert-as-service](https://github.com/hanxiao/bert-as-service) 套件，搭配 [BERT-Base, Uncased(12-layer, 768-hidden, 12-heads, 110M parameters)](https://storage.googleapis.com/bert_models/2018_10_18/uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12.zip) pretrained model 輸出 sentence representation。\n",
    "\n",
    "我會選擇上面那個 model 單純只是因為 GPU 記憶體只塞得進這個 model 的關係，如果用更大的 model 可想而知效果應該會更好。\n",

    "    pip install bert-serving-client  # client, independent of `bert-serving-server`\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2. Download pretrain model\n",
    "3. Start the BERT service\n",
    "    在同一台電腦的 shell 輸入底下的 command，並且直到 shell 輸出 all set, ready to serve request!\n",
    "    另外 num_worker 會牽扯到記憶體用量，如果一直沒有輸出 all workers ready，有可能就是因為記憶體不夠的關係。\n",
