EVER! Is this really how you want people to look at your company, as someone who doesn’t care at all about their customers? Because this is the view I and many others have on your company as it is now. There are so many great companies out there who give great support and even to those customers who haven’t spent a lot of money on their products (even companies where you use their free versions only give good support) and you know why? Because happy customers come back! Dissatisfied customers do not. I have lost all trust in you, to me you are not trustworthy and I have no desire to ever spend any money at all again on any of your products. I have problems with your software on my brand new PC which an IT worker helped me build for the sake of it being good for video editing as well as photo editing and gaming, so it can take a lot… but I still have problems with PowerDirector 13 and it is not my CPU or any other technical stuff on my PC (yes, I have checked). I also had tons of problems with it being incredibly slow on my other PC, which is why I bought a new one, as I thought it was the PC, but now I see it is definitely not my PC (and the worst part is, it worked a little bit better on my old slow PC than on my new fast PC). So tell me, what will it take for you to understand the value of happy customers and for you to actually give support that helps, or at least respond as you used to but without giving any help… not that it will do much good, but it’s better than ignoring your customers? Because I have read so many furious reviews about your customer service that it may someday affect you and you lose even more customers… oh, I am very sure you have lost cutomers, at least you just lost me… for I had hoped to get help to get it to work and then buy PD16 upgrade, but that’s definitely not going to happen… Because even the free trial of PD16 is extremely slow and hey, I don’t get help from you guys to get it to work, so I can’t buy it. I hope you consider giving better support in future, because you can get so many more customers if you do and you can keep those you already have. It’s your own choice. I don’t care. You already lost me, unless you can give me support that actually works and I will not buy PD16 if I can’t get it while it is 70% off and ONLY if you can give me support so I can get PD13 and PD16 and future versions to work smoothly.

If you look at my account you will notice I havent posted any photos yet, that's because I was trying to make sure this site wasn't as public or invasive as Facebook and/or Instagram. I joined because I want to feel a part of something NOT so judgemental and opinionated, but rather just fun. Like hanging with the girls and having make over nights. ☺   But being disqualified due to no IG seems a little unfair. Would you please consider opening up some of the giveaways to include non-IG members?   Side note - while participating in live chats recently some of the ages of the users has come up which isnt a big deal but I did note some were only in middle school... :/ so setting a good example for them isnt to direct them to the imposible to achieve looks of the beauty models that are all over IG - but close to what you have now, which is to have them live chat with REAL girls that arent all doing the same makeup looks. Some seem over the top, but there are alot of down to earth users on here that host live chats that I think are positive. I have never witnessed anything even so much as an unkind comment during a live chat which really kind of blows my mind still. Night and day different from IG where often times people are attacked from behind a keyboard and end up having to remove content just because of the hate.   I hope you keep promoting positivity!  So.... Do your users a favor and be more all-inclusive, you do have very friendly users of all ages, and we dont all have social media.
